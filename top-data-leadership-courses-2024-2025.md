## Personal Insights

As someone deeply passionate about Data Leadership, I'm excited to share some insights from my own experiences. In 2018, I had the privilege of participating in HBS's Big Data Certificate for Executives, which was an incredibly enriching experience.

This summer, I aim to create an even better course to help others in their data leadership journey. Drawing from my decade of experience in the data industry, including five years in leadership roles, I hope to impart valuable knowledge during my upcoming teaching engagement at Stanford Continuing Studies.

My goal is to develop a course that not only covers the technical aspects of data science but also addresses the unique challenges and opportunities that leaders face when driving data-driven transformation in their organizations.

Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting venture!
