## Data Interview Questions That I Asked

This document contains all the questions I designed and asked in my previous roles at Amazon, Uber, Stitch Fix, and Shipt, as a data leader.

The questions may not be exactly the same each time, as I often asked variants. However, the design thinking behind them is consistent.

### Summary Table
| No. | Question | Focus Areas | Difficulty | Frequency | Level | Review Priority | Workplace Usage | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------------|------------|-----------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | What's the difference between Perceptrons and Neural Networks? | machine learning, deep learning, statistics | basics | rare | junior | must know | infrequent | While this basic question may not appear often and interviews are generally more challenging now, it's crucial to understand even if not asked directly |
| 2 | Explain overfitting and underfitting. How can they be avoided? | machine learning, statistics | basics | often | junior | must know | frequent | These are fundamental concepts in machine learning; understanding and explaining them is essential for any data scientist |
| 3 | Describe a real-world problem you've solved using machine learning. | case study, comprehensive | advanced | often | senior | top priority | frequent | This open-ended question is common in senior position interviews. Prepare several specific cases to showcase your practical experience |
| 4 | Explain the gradient descent algorithm. | machine learning, algorithms & data structure CS | basics | often | junior | must know | frequent | This is a foundational optimization algorithm used in many machine learning models |
| 5 | Compare L1 and L2 regularization. | machine learning, statistics | advanced | it depends | senior | normal | frequent | This question can test a candidate's deep understanding of regularization techniques |
| 6 | Explain how decision trees work. | machine learning, algorithms & data structure CS | basics | often | junior | must know | frequent | Decision trees are a basic but important model. Understanding their principles helps in comprehending more complex ensemble methods |
| 7 | Describe the largest dataset you've worked with and how you handled it. | case study, comprehensive | advanced | often | senior | top priority | frequent | This question can demonstrate your experience and ability to handle large-scale data |
| 8 | Explain how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) work. | deep learning | advanced | it depends | senior | normal | infrequent | Essential for those specifically working on computer vision tasks, but may be less important for others |
| 9 | How do you handle missing values in a dataset? | statistics, machine learning | basics | often | junior | must know | frequent | This is a common issue in data preprocessing. Every data scientist should be familiar with multiple handling methods |
| 10 | Explain the meaning of P-value. | statistics | basics | it depends | junior | normal | infrequent | While important in some fields, it's not as commonly used in many machine learning applications |
