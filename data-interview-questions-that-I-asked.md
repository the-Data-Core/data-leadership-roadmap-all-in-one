## Data Interview Questions That I Asked

This document contains all the questions I designed and asked in my previous roles at Amazon, Uber, Stitch Fix, and Shipt, as a data leader.

The questions may not be exactly the same each time, as I often asked variants. However, the design thinking behind them is consistent.
